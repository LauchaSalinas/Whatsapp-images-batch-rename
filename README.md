# Whatsapp-images-batch-rename
Renamer app for Whatsapp downloaded images in proper order.

Usually when you download Whatsapp images in a batch you will get zip file with a ton of .jpeg files with the date and hour. Duplicates will get a "(x)" ending, which does not apply to the first image and this affects chronological order.

For a while, solution was to manually add a " (0)" at the end of the first files for each time stamped file.

Now with this renamer you can type the route of the folder which contains the uncompressed zip with the jpeg files and automatically changes the name for each file.
